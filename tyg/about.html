                                Junior “The Young God” Younan is a super middleweight boxer and is considered one of New York City’s best boxing prospects.<br><br>

 

                                The Brooklyn native initially laced up his first pair of gloves as a two-year-old, but didn’t start fighting competitively until the age of eight. With father Sherif – a former professional boxer – as his trainer, Younan began receiving acclaim before becoming a pre-teen, starting with The New York Times dubbing him “a boxing prodigy” as a 10-year-old.
                                <br><br>
                                 
                                
                                Despite the massive expectations, Younan blossomed into a standout fighter, compiling a 90-5 amateur record and earning honors as a nine-time Junior Olympic champion, nine-time Junior Metro champion, eight-time New York State Silver Gloves champion and five-time Regional Silver Gloves champion.
                                <br><br>
                                 
                                
                                He was also a four-time National Silver Gloves champion, three-time Ringside World champion, three-time National PAL champion and two-time National Junior Golden Gloves champion, which ultimately earned him the distinction as USA Boxing’s No. 1-rated junior boxer in his weight class.
                                <br><br>
                                 
                                
                                Less than a month after his 18th birthday, Younan turned pro and made his debut on November 9, 2013 in Brooklyn, New York, where he toppled Kenneth Schmitz in the first round. With a flurry of combinations, Younan followed up his debut with three consecutive first-round knockouts, making quick work of Travis McClaren, Thomas Allen and Dustin Parrish.
                                
                                <br><br>
                                
                                Of Younan’s first seven professional fights, six ended in knockouts – only Azamat Umarzoda went the distance before losing to Younan via unanimous-decision on July 2, 2014. Younan’s dazzling display opened the door for him to sign an exclusive promotional agreement with Roc Nation Sports in February 2015.
                                <br><br>
                                 
                                
                                In his first fight under the Roc Nation Sports banner on June 6, 2015, Younan delivered another memorable performance at Barclays Center, notching a second-round TKO over Mike Sawyer on the undercard of the Miguel Cotto vs. Daniel Geale fight.
                                
                                <br><br>
                                
                                Nagging injuries would keep Younan out of the ring until March 2016, when he easily scored a unanimous decision against Cristian Solorzano at Oracle Arena. Later that year, Younan returned to Oakland, where floored Jinner Guerrero – who was riding a six-win streak – in the first round to add another TKO to his tally.
                                <br><br>
                                 
                                
                                Younan opened 2017 with a convincing victory over Victor Darocha and rode that momentum into his first career fight in Las Vegas on June 17, 2017. Fighting on the Andre Ward-Sergey Kovalev 2 undercard at Mandalay Bay, he wasted little time with Hungarian veteran Zoltan Sera, dropping him at the 1:39 mark in the first round.
                                <br><br>
                                 
                                
                                Most recently, Younan endured one of the toughest bouts of his young career, outlasting Mike Guy to win an eight-round decision and protect his unblemished record.
